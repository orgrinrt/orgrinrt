### Hey

I'm a loser.

I like rain.

That's all.






### Some words about me

I'm a software engineer student from the cold north, studying @ JAMK.

When I'm not learning engineering stuff (and failing miserably) I like to dabble with all sorts of different projects and never finish anything. 
This is just my natural instinct to ensure that I will never have a great portfolio.

I also like to spend my evenings with all things creative:
* I'm making a fool of myself in various bands in wildly different genres, so as to shed any last remnants of my authenticy. Fun fact: I was studying for my master's degree in musicology before it dawned on me that I didn't really know what I was doing and had to abandon that dream. Never even finished my bachelor's, so that went just about as well as you'd think when it comes to me.
* I write (horribly) and lately (read: across several years) I've given writing a book a shot. I managed almost 100.000 words before I had to accept that none of it was salvageable. I'm still stuck in the actual accepting part though. Every once in a while when I'm shopping for groceries I get a flashback to those moments of pure inspiration and release an audible groan and half-yell "I'm such a fucking loser" when I remember how ridiculously bad all of it was.
* I once worked some years on a web comic and I sometimes still wake up at night and get this dreadful sense of shame because of it.
* When I was young I wanted to learn oil painting and being the privileged white guy that I am, I was blessed with the chance. I was absolutely cringeworthy and got literally laughed out of the course by my peers. Talk about defining moments in our life!

Even though I sound cynical, I love life üåà, I love people üòç, I love nature üåÑ, I love the world üéâ. I just fucking hate myself ü§†.

### Various things I know something about or the like

* Somewhat understandable (and awkwardly pretentious) English for, uh, international... things?
* How to aimlessly roam the wild woods and swamps of Finnish Lappland
    * I was actually born in a small village, the name of which translates to "Village of War" in English
* .NET and miscellaneous frameworks for it
* Know the bare minimum about OOP, IoC, DI, DOD, ECS, MVC, MVVM 
    * (I guess one has to use all these flashy acronyms to look like they know what they are talking about (I don't))
* Web frameworks (laravel, asp.net/blazor, next.js)
* How to not only be a failure, but to look like one too!
* Godot, unity, a little bit of cryengine
* Some absolute basics about networking and cybersecurity
* How to give a very convincing attempt at making artisan bread from scratch (emphasis on the *convincing attempt* part)
* I guess I'm technically officially a Laird in Scotland
* Showing off how little I actually know about anything by trying to be funny and pad this list with all these "hilarious" items so that it looks longer

### Hiring

Honestly, I would probably be the worst possible guy for any gig you would likely have.

I'm still open for offers. I have this tingling sense that I need more opportunities to prove myself completely useless and waste everyone's time while at it ü§©

Throw me a message somewhere. I try to avoid social media, so, uh... I guess it's a very unique thing to suggest that you do some detective work to find out how to contact me? I mean it's totally not worth it, like at all, but I guess I can lull myself to that sweet, peaceful slumber thinking I'm unique?
